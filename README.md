# AirBnb Text Mining
## Dataset Source: MongoDB Sample Data Collection
### Business with Unstructured Data | Individual Assignment Grade: 88/100
### Professor Comment:
Overall Feedback:
This is a very good submission that demonstrates strong coding skills and effective application of the relevant frameworks covered in the course. The project aligns well with the assignment requirements and delivers meaningful analysis. To further improve the overall clarity and impact, better focus in presentation and more thoughtful integration of visualizations into the main body of the report would be beneficial.

What was done well:

Strong Technical Execution: Your Python code is clear and well-structured, showing confidence with the tools and techniques introduced during the course.

Appropriate Use of Frameworks: You successfully applied most of the key frameworks, which contributed to a solid and structured analytical approach.

Areas for improvement:

Focus and Report Presentation: The report would benefit from a more concise and focused presentation. The appendix is overly extensive, and some of that content—particularly key visualizations—should be moved into the main body to better support your findings.

Integration of Visualizations: Including the most relevant graphs and visuals directly in the main report would improve readability and make your insights more accessible and impactful.
### Assignment Instruction:
Description of assignment:

The Project uses data from Airbnb dataset. Airbnb is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals and tourism activities. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; instead, it profits by receiving a commission from each booking.

How to get the dataset?

Each student will need to deploy a free MongoDB cluster. After deploying the cluster, the student will be able to load “sample data” that includes the AirBnb collection of documents. Instructions on how to deploy a free MongoDB cluster will be given during the course

After deploying the cluster and getting the data, the student will use Python to connect to the cluster and retrieve the data

Deliverables:
You were hired by Airbnb to analyze descriptions of postings. The Airbnb management team wants to know if there are any business insights that can be found in the postings’ content (text content and numerical content)
You will explore the data to create relevant visualizations in Python. It is also expected to perform text analysis using Python

For this project, you will submit 2 files:

A project report - details below
A Collab Notebook with code that structures the textual data from Airbnb and performs text mining frameworks and visualisations, together with relevant explanations.
The written report must follow the following format: single-spaced, 12-point font, Times New Roman, and be no longer than 3 pages. In the appendix of the report, you will include screenshots of visual assets and the Python code (that was used to structure the text data) Please include the following elements in your written report and make sure to export to a PDF format:

Executive summary with business insight.
Describe at least 4 visualizations created.
Explain key findings and business insights from the text data.
